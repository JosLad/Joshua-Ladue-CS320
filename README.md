You can ensure that your code is functional and secure by doing a few things. The things that I would recommend are to make sure to write high quality code, and to throughouly and effectively test your code as you are going through it. Doing things like commenting and documenting your code is also a good way to keep things more functional as there will be a lesser chance anything will be forgotten or missed. This also helps with any situations where multiple people might have to work on the same code, so it is more likely that everyone will be on the same page.

You can interpret user needs by gathering feedback from different kinds of users with different kinds of opinions. You can look through these and try to discover common themes or criticisms and picture ways that these can be addressed through diffreent changes or new features into your program. After this has been done, you can begin on actually fullfilling these needs.

I think that a good way to approach designing software is too go about it carefully and in segments. I would make sure to take your time making sure that there are as little imperfections as possible and the code is written to its fullest utilizing the highest standards, as well as consistantly testing the software to make sure that nothing goes wrong.
